# Replying in IRC

#### What's the equivalent of @'ing someone in IRC?

When someone mentions your handle in an IRC message, you'll receive a
notification. If you want to reply to that person, just start typing
their username handle, followed by a tab (for autocompletion)

```
08:44:54      patrick | spongebob: Psst, hey sponge, can I borrow a quarter?
08:45:00    spongebob | patrick: Sure Patrick!
```
