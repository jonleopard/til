# Creating a Branch

##### To create a branch:

Generally anytime you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, you'll want to
create a new branch for it.

`git branch <branch_name>`

After you created the branch, you'll then need switch to it via `git checkout`:

`git checkout <branch_name>`

##### All in one shortcut:

An easy one liner to accomplish both steps:

`git checkout -b <branch_name>`
